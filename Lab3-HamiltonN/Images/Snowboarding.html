        <h3>Different Types of Snoboards</h3>
        <p>In the snowboarding world there are three main types of snowboards: All Mountain, Freestyle, and Alpine. The boards have their own unique construction, material, shape, flex pattern and size. There is no answer to the type of snowboard you should ride. It all depends on your height, weight, preference and riding style.</p>
        <P>All-mountain snowboards are the most popular snowboard as theyâ€™re designed to perform well anywhere on the mountain: to float well on powder surface, carve on the pistes and handle lumps and bumps. Freestyle snowboards are light, short and flexible, designed mainly for performing tricks in terrain parks and halfpipes. They have a limited edge grip and are not stable enough for carving turns and travelling fast. The alpine is narrower compared to all mountain and freestyle, configured for riding and carving downhill and not suitable for performing tricks. The long, narrow and stiff design is meant for higher speed and cleaner carved turns. The alpine is ideal if you are looking for a board that will deliver quick edge turns and stability for speed.</P>
